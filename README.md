This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple eCommerce site for Tobita's Crochet Items. All the items are hand made to order and her website needed desparate updating after being active for nearly 20 years.

I used React and the context API to create the shopping cart and product list functionality as opposed to using Redux for state management. It ended up being a more efficient solution. Also, I used PayPal as a checkout method, since that is what Tobita used for years and is comfortable with it. Finally, the contact form was built from scratch.

Hope this helps with some folks looking to to eCommerce sites!
