                Tobita.  Tobita enjoys crocheting for 
                others to enjoy.  There is not a moment that you will not see her without 
                her yarn or thread and crochet hook crocheting away.  She crochets

                Tobita learned to crochet when she was 11 years old.  At first, there were 
                simple projects for a beginner to learn like granny squares and potholders. 
                As years have passed, a lot has changed. Now there are shawls, blankets, 
                sweaters, ponchos, doilies, toys,and so much more that can be made.  The items are endless! 
                Not just the good ole squares as they used to say. 
                <br></br>

                With over 25 years of crochet experience, you will find 
                the items are crocheted with love, passion and faith. 
                Tobita uses the best quality yarn and threads available in the market.
